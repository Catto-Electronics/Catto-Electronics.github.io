      "content"     : "OverviewSorting resistors is a tedious task. Reading the color bands becomes harder when the color of the resistor has low constrast with the color bands. A solution for sorting resistors is to use a multimeter with an intgrated ohm meter. The following design process is for an ohm meter that displays the value, nearest standard value, and percent error of the resistor.MeasurmentStandard ValuesResistor values are spaced apart on a logorithmic scale. The E-series denotes that every decade is divided by that number. The following formula, sourced from Jeremy Webbâ€™s website, is used to calculate the standard resistor values.\\(\\begin{align}R = d \\ast 10^{\\frac{i}{N}},\\end{align}\\)\\(\\begin{align}\\begin{array}{r | l} \\text{} &amp; d \\text{ = decade multiplier: 10, 100, 1k, ...}\\\\ \\text{where} &amp; N \\text{ = E-series: 12, 24, 48, 96}\\\\ \\text{} &amp; i = 0 ... N-1\\end{array}\\end{align}\\)The E-series 12, 24, 48, 96, have tolerances of 10%, 5%, 2%, 1% respectively. E24 series resistors are also available with a tolerance of 1%.ErrorPercent error (err) shows how much a resistor deviates from the standard (Std.) value as a percentage.\\(\\begin{align}err = \\frac{Measured - Std.}{Std.}*100\\%,\\end{align}\\)A negative percentage denotes a measured value lower than the standard. The direction of deviation is insignificant, since resistors are chosen with tolerance in mind.ImplementationUPDATES COMING SOON"
